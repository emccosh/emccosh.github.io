            <p>I absolutely love this sushi place! I think they ambiance is beautiful and they were so polite and patient. I went for lunch and I've been to most of the baltimore sushi places and this one had the best price and gave the most food for the bento boxes that they offered. They even went above and beyond and added a really cool orange cut up like sushi in the middle. I was very impressed. It wasn't super busy at the time, but I didn't observe a language barrier or any confusion from them when I had a few questions to ask. So personally I love that the most because that seems to be my biggest issue with most international food places.</p>

            <p>The sushi here is so good- and I am really picky. I usually order take out but came in today and sat at the sushi bar. I ordered the dynamite roll- perfect amount of spice and crunch. The guys behind the sushi bar were super nice. Will definitely be back!!</p>
