<h3>Brian R.</h3>       
<p>I absolutely love this sushi place! I think they ambiance is beautiful and they were so polite and patient. I went for lunch and I've been to most of the baltimore sushi places and this one had the best price and gave the most food for the bento boxes that they offered. They even went above and beyond and added a really cool orange cut up like sushi in the middle. I was very impressed. It wasn't super busy at the time, but I didn't observe a language barrier or any confusion from them when I had a few questions to ask. So personally I love that the most because that seems to be my biggest issue with most international food places.</p>
<p>I'd highly recommend coming to this location if you want a good sushi experience. There's also hibachi but I didn't try the hibachi that day.</p>

<p>The sushi here is so good- and I am really picky. I usually order take out but came in today and sat at the sushi bar. I ordered the dynamite roll- perfect amount of spice and crunch. The guys behind the sushi bar were super nice. Will definitely be back!!</p>

<p>We have eaten here several times, as it is a quick walk from Anchorage Marina. We are very surprised at the reviews about poor service and bland food. We do not eat sushi, but always order several small plates from the Kitchen Menu. Our favorites are the pork Gyoza, the shrimp Shumai and the Negi Maki (egg rolls). Each time our food has been fresh and tasty. We have also shared the Beef Teriyaki, which was flavorful. We eat in the booths area and have always had attentive, but not intrusive, service. We are there at dinner time (6ish) and take at least an hour or so to eat and enjoy each other's company. The music is at a level where you can actually have a conversation and not have to shout. It's a good place for date night.</p>
