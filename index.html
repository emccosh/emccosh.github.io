                <h2>Writing the Cover Letter</h2>

                <p>Today we'll be talking about cover letters for short story submissions! If anyone's looking for query letter advice, I have an excellent resource at the end of the article.</p>
        
                
                <h3>Follow the rules, they’re helpful!</h3>
                <p>Most magazines will list what they want in the cover letter. They'll also tell you what not to include. Read the guidelines!</p>
            
                <h3>Address the proper person.</h3>
                <p>Right off the bat, make sure you’re addressing your cover letter to an editor who actually works at the magazine. There’s nothing worse than saying “Dear Editor X” when Editor X hasn’t worked there in a year and it’s now “Dear Editor Y”. You avoid this by checking the guidelines and/or about page of the magazine, even if you’ve submitted there before.</p>
                <p>If you don’t know how to address the letter, saying “hello”, “good morning”, “dear editors” or “dear [magazine name]” is perfectly acceptable. "To whom is may concern" might make it look like you didn't care enough to check the guidelines, even if the editor's name isn't there. Personally, I address an editor by name if I have a previously established relationship with them (as in: I’ve sold them a story before, had a rewrite request, or they’ve personally asked me to submit). Other than that, I usually just say “hello”.</p>
            
                <h3>Give the story info.</h3>
                <p>Make sure to include the name, genre, and length of your story. This is the main purpose of the cover letter and will make sure the editor can find your story title if the attachment gets lost. It also lets the editor know your story is the right genre and length for their magazine and you haven’t sent them something wild.</p>
            
                <h3>Include past publications and relevant experience.</h3>
                <p>If you have previous publication credits, published novels/novellas, have attended a workshop like Clarian, or have relevant experience, these are great things to include.</p>
                <p>Relevant experience being something along the lines of: “After being abducted by jellyfish aliens, I wrote this story about alien abductions!” 
                <p>Or, ya know, something more normal...</p>
                <p>I’d recommend listing the top three publications you’re most proud of and/or hold the most esteem. If you have no previous publications, it’s no big deal, just don’t list anything. Lots of editors are looking to publish new writers for the first time!</p>
            
                <h3>Finally, if the magazine asks for anything else, include it!</h3>
                <p>This is basically what you need. If your cover letter seems too short, that’s probably just your writer brain getting in the way. You’re giving the editor the information they need without overwriting or getting in your own way.</p>
                <p>Unless the editor asks for something other than this, you’re safe to give a nice salutation and sign off.</p>
                
                <h3>Novel query letters/cover letters.</h3>
                <p>If you’re looking for query letter advice (including cover letters for novels), check out <a href="https://jetreidliterary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Janet Reid’s daily blog</a> as well as her <a href="https://queryshark.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">QueryShark blog.</a></p>
                
            
                <h3>Since examples are great, here’s an example of my standard cover letter:</h3>
                <i>
                <p>Hello/Dear Editor,</p>
                <p>I’m sending my 3,400-word science fiction story “Best Story Title Ever”. My fiction has appeared in Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Shimmer, Galaxy’s Edge, and elsewhere. Thank you for your time and consideration.
                I hope you enjoy the story!</p>
                <p>Emily McCosh</p>
                </i>
            
                <h3>Have fun!</h3>
                <p>That's the basics of writing a cover letter for short story submissions. Happy story submitting!</p>
