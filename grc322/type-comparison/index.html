        <h3>Typeface history</h3>
        
            <h4>Adobe Garamond</h4>

            <p>
            The original typeface was made in the 16th century, by Claude Garamond for King Francis I. It was based on Angelo Vergecio's handwriting, who was the king's librarian. In the late 1980's Robert Slimbach was tasked with creating a new version of Garamond for Adobeand was released in 1989.

            <H4>Minion</H4>
            <p>Minion was also designed by Robert Slimbach and was released in 1990 by Linotype. Slimbach took inspiration from Renaissance typefaces that were both elegant and highly readable. Slimbach wanted it to be really readable and because of that, it is used a lot for use on screens.</p>
